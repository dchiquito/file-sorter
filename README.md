# file-sorter

You need python installed. I used Python 3.8.8, but whatever should be fine.

# Usage
```
python sort.py /wherever/your/files/are/ /wherever/you/want/them/sorted
```

# Testing

I tested this with this command:
```
python sort.py test_src test_dest
```
It moved all the files to the places I expected them to.
